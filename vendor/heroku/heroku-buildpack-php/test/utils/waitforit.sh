		${1:-Execute a given program and terminate after timeout or line match.}
		
		Usage:
		  waitforit [options] <DURATION> <TEXT_TO_MATCH> <COMMAND...>
		
		The given COMMAND will be terminated after the given number of seconds, or the
		given TEXT_TO_MATCH has matched, whichever comes first.
		
		The exit status of 'waitforit' will be the exit status of 'timeout' if the
		given TEXT_TO_MATCH did not match, or 0 otherwise.
		
		DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix:
		's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.
		It can also be a string of 'timeout' options and duration; the argument is
		passed to 'timeout' unquoted.
		
		TEXT_TO_MATCH is a 'grep -E' expression.
		
		One particularly useful aspect of this program is that if stdout is a pipe,
		the program behaves so that it writes the matched text to stdout, and will
		then wait for the receiving end of the pipe to close before terminating the
		program. This can be used to perform another operation once the given text has
		matched, e.g.:
		
		waitforit 15 "ready for connections" start-web-server.sh | \
			{ read && curl http://localhost:8080/test | grep "hello world"; }
		
		The 'read' statement waits for the matched text to occur and thus blocks the
		execution of the curl/grep test operation until the server has started. It is
		important to chain the commands following 'read' using '&&', as 'read' will
		have a non-zero exit status if the 'waitforit' invocation timed out or did
		not match the desired string.
